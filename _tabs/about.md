I am a security professional with a background in both application development and penetration testing.  Previously, I honed my technical skills as a backend developer, fostering a deep understanding of how systems are built.  This experience now allows me to approach security testing from a unique perspective, leveraging my development knowledge to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

I actively participate in Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe, continuously sharpening my skills and staying at the forefront of evolving security threats.

As a penetration tester, I specialize in uncovering vulnerabilities across various attack vectors, including networks, web, and mobile applications.
