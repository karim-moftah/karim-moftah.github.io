## karim@kali:~# whoami



Iâ€™m a **security professional** with a background in **application development** and **penetration testing**. My journey began as a software engineer, where I built a solid understanding of how systems are structured and how applications work under the hood. That foundation now gives me a unique edge in security testing. I can think like both a builder and a breaker.

I regularly participate in **Capture-the-Flag (CTF)** challenges on platforms such as **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, **PentesterLab**, **PortSwigger**, and **Mobile Hacking Lab** to keep my skills sharp and stay ahead of evolving security threats.

As a **penetration tester**, I focus on discovering and analyzing vulnerabilities across **web**, **mobile**, and **network** environments, helping organizations strengthen their defenses and build more secure systems.
